The Water Cycle
What is the Water Cycle?
The water cycle is a way that water moves all around the Earth. It never stops, it does
not have a beginning or an end. It's like a big circle!
Did you know?
- The water cycle is also known as the “hydrologic cycle”
- Earth has been recycling water for over 4 billion years!
- Do plants sweat? Well, sort of.... People perspire (sweat) and plants transpire.
Transpiration is the process by which plants lose water out of their leaves. 
So how can we understand this magical process called the water cycle?
There are four main parts to the water cycle: Evaporation, Convection, Precipitation
and Collection.
1) Evaporation
Evaporation is when the sun heats up water in rivers or lakes or the ocean and turns
it into vapour or steam. The water vapour or steam leaves the river, lake or ocean
and goes into the air.
We have already learnt about transpiration, did you know that transpiration gives
evaporation a bit of a hand in getting the water vapour back up into the air!
2) Convection
Convection in the water cycle is when the air near the surface is heated, then rises
taking heat with it. Water vapour in the air gets cold and changes back into liquid,
forming clouds. This is called condensation.
You can see the same sort of thing at home... Pour a glass of cold water on a hot day
and watch what happens. Water forms on the outside of the glass. That water
didn't somehow leak through the glass! It actually came from the air. Water vapour
in the warm air, turns back into liquid when it touches the cold glass!
3) Precipitation
Precipitation occurs when so much water has condensed that the air cannot hold it
anymore. The clouds get heavy and water falls back to the earth in the form of rain,
hail, sleet or snow.
4) Collection/Storage
A lot of the Earth's water does not take part in the water cycle very often. Much of it
is stored. The Earth stores water in a number of places. The ocean is the largest
storage of water. Around 96% of the Earth's water is stored in the ocean. We can't
drink the salty ocean water, so fortunately for us, freshwater is also stored in lakes,
glaciers, snow caps, rivers, and below the ground in groundwater storage.
