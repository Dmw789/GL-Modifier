Jake liked to pretend. He draped a blanket  over his shoulders. The blanket turned into a  robe. Jake had become a king! Jake asked his  mom to make waffles for  
breakfast. He did not  
think kings ate oatmeal. 
Jake grew tired of being  
a king. He laid the  
blanket out flat on the  
floor and sat in the middle of  
it. The blanket turned into a magic carpet. Jake  made swishing sounds as if he was flying. He  leaned one way and then the other pretending  to steer.
Jake landed his magic carpet and crumpled up  the blanket’s edges. The blanket  
turned into an island in the  
sea. Jake’s cat became a sea  
monster! Jake battled the sea  
monster who kept trying to  
crawl up on his beach. 
After the battle, Jake grew hungry. He draped  the blanket between two chairs to make a tent.  Jake asked his mom to cook hot dogs for lunch.  His mom always made hot dogs when they went  camping. 
After eating the hot dogs, Jake grew tired of  camping. He draped the blanket over his  shoulders. This time the blanket turned into a  cape. Jake became a superhero! He grabbed  the corners of his cape and spread out his arms. 
He flew through the house looking for someone  to rescue. Jake found his sister reading a book,  but she did not want to be rescued.  
Jake felt a tug on his cape. His dog Bandit had  grabbed the end of Jake’s blanket. Jake pulled  on one end of the blanket. Bandit pulled on the  other end of the blanket. The blanket turned  into a rope in a game of tug-of-war. 
Jake grew tired, climbed into bed and took a  nap. On top of him, his blanket turned into a  blanket.
