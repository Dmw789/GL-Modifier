Every living thing goes through changes. Living things grow through 

different stages. Then they reach the end of their 

life cycles and die. There are many kinds of plants. 

Each kind has its own life cycle. Many plants start 

their life cycles as a seed. The seed needs certain 

things or it will not grow into a plant. Sometimes 

seeds wait in the ground until they can get the 

things they need. They wait for warmth from the sun. 

They wait for water. When they have what they need, 

they start to grow. A tiny little sprout will push 

out of each seed. The sprouts stretch up until they 

poke through the dirt and into the air. 

The plants continue to grow when they get sunshine and 

water. The stems grow taller and leaves unfold. More 

leaves and stems grow on the main stems. The adult 

plants grow flowers. The flowers of many plants make 

fruit. The fruit has seeds inside it so more new 

plants can grow. New plants look like their parent 

plants. Seeds from a parent plant will grow into the 

same kind of plant as the parent. When a seed begins 

to grow, it is the beginning of another plant life cycle.
