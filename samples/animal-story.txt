The Animal Assignment

A chorus of groans erupted from Mr. Trevino’s class. It was late

Friday afternoon and his students were looking forward to the long

weekend. No one wanted homework!

“Hold on,” Mr. Trevino said. He raised his hands in front of him to

silence the rush of complaints from his students. “I promise to make

this one fun. Your assignment will be to write about an animal you

want to be.”

“Can it be any animal?” Jayden asked.

“You can pick any animal you like, but you need to do some

research. I want you to think about this,” Mr. Trevino said. “Part of

your assignment will be to explain the reasons for your choice.”

Students were still comparing animals when the school bell rang.

Landon thought he wanted to be a bear. Kiera said she wanted to

be a unicorn, and everyone laughed.

“You have to pick a real animal,”

Landon said, and rolled his eyes.

Jayden thought about picking a fox. He

thought foxes looked cool. He also liked

the way they pounced on their prey in

nature films.

On Saturday, Jayden started searching the internet. He looked for

safe sites with good information, like zoos. He discovered red foxes

run up to 30 miles per hour and can hear a mouse squeak from up to

100 feet away. However, he also learned foxes get preyed on by lots

of other animals like wolves, bears, and cougars. Jayden wanted the

animal he picked to be higher up in the food chain.

Jayden wondered about picking a cougar. He learned only humans

hunt adult cougars. He read cougars run up to 40 miles per hour in a

sprint. Jayden thought it might be awesome to leap 18-feet like a

cougar. He also discovered cougars spend a lot of time living alone.

Jayden wanted the animal he picked to live with a family.

Next, Jayden researched the dolphin. He discovered that dolphin

families live together in groups called pods. He read about how

smart dolphins are and how they talk using clicks and squeaks. He

thought it might be fun to race through the water at 18 miles per

hour like a dolphin. He also learned about the things that pollute the

seas the dolphins swim in. Jayden wanted the animal he picked

to have a clean place to live. This assignment was turning out to

be a lot harder than Jayden imagined.

On Sunday, Jayden returned to his search. He thought

about being a koala until he found out they only

eat leaves. He thought about being a giraffe

until he found out they can grow 18-feet tall.

Jayden did not like being in high places. He

thought about being a bull until he read

about bullfights. Jayden began to worry he

would not have a paper to hand in on Tuesday.

Sitting in front of the computer on Monday morning, Jayden got a

great idea. The animal he was thinking about couldn’t run as fast as

a fox. It couldn’t leap like a cougar or swim like a dolphin. It

couldn’t fight like a bull. It wasn’t as cute as a koala or as tall as a


giraffe. But his animal did have some special attributes.

After he checked some facts online, he started writing. He stopped

to think about his reasons, like his teacher had asked them to, and

then Jayden wrote some more. By dinner time, Jayden had finished

his assignment. He hoped Mr. Trevino would like it.

Late the following Friday afternoon, Mr. Trevino stood in

front of the class holding a stack of papers.

“I’ve finished reading your animal assignments, and they

show a lot of imagination. I would like to point out one

student who made a unique choice. Jayden, can you

stand up and tell the class what animal you wrote about and why?”

Jayden was happy that the teacher liked his work, but he did not

want to stand up and tell the class what he wrote. He was so

embarrassed his face felt warm and he knew he was turning red.

“Well,” Jayden began. “The animal I wrote about wanting to be was

a human. Humans may not run or swim as fast or see or hear as well

as other animals, but they have giant brains. Humans can

communicate and share our ideas. We can learn things and write

down what we learn so that other humans can learn even more.

Dogs can chase balls and foxes can chase rabbits, which is all fine,

but I want to learn how to build a rocket ship and go to the moon

someday. That is way cooler. I choose to stay human.”
