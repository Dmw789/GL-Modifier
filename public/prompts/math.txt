INSTRUCTIONS:

If translating to a lower grade level:
1. Maintain the same concepts but reduce the difficulty and complexity of the problem to make it more easily solvable to someone who is very new to the concepts being presented.
2. If a question is a word problem, alter the verbiage to use verbiage that is approriate for the new grade level.
3. If a question is a word problem, create notes that may guide the student along to help find the answer.

If translating to a higher grade level:
1. For all arithmetic questions, change numbers so that the problem is more difficult to solve.
2. For all word problems, introduce variables that may make it more difficult when appropriate.
