If translating to a lower grade level:
1. Maintain the same concept, but reduce the difficulty of the problem.
2. Reduce the necessary information needed to solve the problem.
3. Restate the question in a simpler form that a lower-grade student will understand.
4. Reduce the complexity of the vocabulary when appropriate.
5. Do not state exactly how to complete the problem, but provide guidance.

If translating to a higher grade level:
1. Maintain the same concepts, but make the problem harder to solve if appropriate.
2. If arithmetic is involved, make sure the problem requires more in-depth calculations.
3. Adjust the verbiage to be more complex when appropriate.
